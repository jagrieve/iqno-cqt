  abstract = {We present a method to map the evolution of photonic quantum walks that is compatible with nonclassical input light. Our approach leverages a newly developed flexible waveguide platform to reconfigure the jumping rate between spatial modes, allowing the observation of a range of evolution times in a chip of fixed length. In a proof-of-principle demonstration we reconstruct the evolution of photons through a uniform array of coupled waveguides by monitoring the end-face while tuning the device. This approach enables direct observation of mode occupancy at arbitrary resolution, extending the utility of photonic qauntum walks for quantum simulations and related applications.}

  abstract = {We propose a robust photonic platform for encapsulation and addressing of optically active 2D- and nanomaterials. Our implementation utilizes a monolayer of MoS2 transition metal dichalcogenide embedded in an elastomeric waveguide chip. The structure is manufactured from PDMS using soft-lithography and capable of sustaining a single mode of guided light. We prove that this setup facilitates addressing of the 2D material flake by pumping it with polarized laser light and gathering polarization-resolved photoluminescence spectra with the extinction ratio of 31, which highlights the potential for selection-rule dependent measurements. Our results demonstrate improved handling of the material and experimental simplification compared to other techniques. Furthermore, inherent elasticity of the host provides an avenue for direct mechanical coupling to embedded materials.}

  abstract = {An application of quantum communications is the transmission of qubits to create shared symmetric encryption keys in a process called quantum key distribution (QKD). Contrary to public-private key encryption, symmetric encryption is considered safe from (quantum) computing attacks, i.e. it provides forward security and is thus attractive for secure communications. In this paper we argue that for free-space quantum communications, especially with satellites, if one assumes that man-in-the-middle attacks can be detected by classical channel monitoring techniques, simplified quantum communications protocols and hardware systems can be implemented that offer improved key rates. We term these protocols photon key distribution (PKD) to differentiate them from the standard QKD protocols. We identify three types of photon sources and calculate asymptotic secret key rates for PKD protocols and compare them to their QKD counterparts. PKD protocols use only one measurement basis which we show roughly doubles the key rates. Furthermore, with the relaxed security assumptions one can establish keys at very high losses, in contrast to QKD where at the same losses privacy amplification would make key generation impossible.}

The sources are being developed iteratively with an early version in orbit already and improved versions soon to be launched. Once fully developed, the photon pair sources can be deployed on more advanced satellites that are equipped with optical links. These can allow for very secure uplinks and downlinks and can be used to establish a global space-based quantum key distribution network.

We fabricated several devices of this type and verified their operation over a range of wavelengths, with access to the full range of input/output ratios. The low cost and relative ease of fabrication of these devices via a modified imprint lithographic technique make them an attractive platform for investigation of large scale optical random walks and related optical phenomena.}

But despite important terrestrial pathfinding precursors on common microgravity platforms and promising proposals to exploit the significant advantages of space quantum missions, large-scale quantum test beds in space are yet to be realised due to the high costs and lead times of traditional ‘Big Space’ satellite development. But the ‘small space’ revolution, spearheaded by the rise of nanosatellites such as CubeSats, is an opportunity to greatly accelerate the progress of quantum space missions by providing easy and affordable access to space and encouraging agile development. We review space quantum science and technology, CubeSats and their rapidly developing capabilities and how they can be used to advance quantum satellite systems.}

Spectral analysis of the collinear, non-degenerate photons suggest that the effective interaction length within the crystal is dominated by the collection beam mode and the use of longer crystals with increased spatial walk-off does not necessarily lead to a reduced collection efficiency. This result is an important consideration for optical designers who seek to develop practical photon pair sources.}

The impact of effective duty cycle on the observed accidental rate is examined and we demonstrate that the updated model leads to an improved correction factor in actual experiments. This will improve the signal-to-noise ratio in applications depending on correlation measurements.}
